## Basic Operators

# Arithmetic Operators

number = 1 + 2 * 3/4.0
print(number) # 2.5

reminder = 11 % 3
print("reminder", reminder)

squared = 10 ** 3
print("squared = ", squared)

# Operators with Strings

helloworld = "hello" + " " + "world"
print(helloworld)

lotsofhellos = "hello" * 10
print(lotsofhellos)

# Using Operators with Lists

even_numbers = [2,4,6,8]
odd_numbers = [1,3,5,7]
all_numbers = odd_numbers + even_numbers
print(all_numbers)

print([1,2,3] * 3)
